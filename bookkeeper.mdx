This app is a fullstack application that allows you to store your books and follow other readers. It is built with Next.js, Prisma, TailwindCSS, TypeScript, and PostgreSQL.
BookKeeper is one of my favorite apps that I have built. I use it to keep track of the books I have read and to find new books to read. I also use it to keep track of the books my friends are reading.

## Features
BookKeeper has the following features:
- Login/Create an account using OAuth provided my Clerk
- Create, Edit, and Delete a book
- Follow other users to stay up to date on what they are reading
- Favorite a book
- Rate a book
- Search for books by reader, genre, or author
- Add books to a wishlist that links to Amazon
- Infinite Scrolling/Pagination

## What's Next?
