This app is a fullstack application where users can create flashcards to study. I implemented openai to generate random flashcards based on a topic entered by the user.
The design was inspired by a retro video game. I used react router to create a multi-page application. I used mongodb to store the flashcards and express to create the backend server.

## Features
StudyPro has the following features:
- Login/Create an account using authentification
- Create, Edit, and Delete a flashcard
- Generate random flashcards based on a topic using AI
- Review flashcards using a spaced repetition algorithm
- Sort flashcards by topic


## Tech Stack
- React
- MongoDB
- Express
- Node.js
- OpenAI API
- Redux

## What's Next?
I plan to add the following features to StudyPro:
- Add a timer to the flashcard review page
- Add a feature to allow users to share flashcards with other users
- Add a way for users to upload images to flashcards
