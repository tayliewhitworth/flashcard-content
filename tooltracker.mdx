This app is a fullstack application where a company can keep track of their tools and manage employees. It is built with React.js, MongoDB, Express, Node.js, and Redux.
The idea came from my dad who wanted a way to manage his tools and employees. He is a contractor and has a lot of tools that he loans out to his employees. He wanted a way to keep track of who has what tool and when it was returned. He also wanted a way to keep track of his employees and their contact information.
